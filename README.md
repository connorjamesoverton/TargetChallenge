    * Note: in the interest of openness, I have not implemented these protections before. I understand that they are usually necessary and I understand their value 
    in a new application, it just hasn't come up yet due to the legacy nature of my primary application. If tasked with implementing such protections, 
    I would research similar protections already in place in my work environment and utilize my team as a resource, recognizing it as an area with a high
    likelihood of mistakes.
